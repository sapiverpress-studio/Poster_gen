# Sapiver Poster Gen — current handover

## 2026-10-08: Canva OAuth callback scaffold

Repository initialised with a minimal README on main. Working branch: feature/canva-oauth-callback.

Implemented:
- HTTPS-pinned callback address and password-protected start form.
- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code + SHA-256 PKCE with a separate CSRF state.
- 10-minute encrypted Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite=Lax browser session cookie.
- Server-only code exchange and encrypted token record in private site-wide Netlify Blobs.
- Default-deny if configuration missing; no tokens returned to the browser.
- Local tests for OAuth helper logic.
- No writes to Sapiver Press sites.

NOT implemented: design exports, refresh-token rotation, Etsy publishing, PrintShrimp fulfilment, print-file storage and automatic product synchronisation.

Required before authorisation: create/connect a dedicated Netlify project, set its four environment variables with Functions scope, deploy branch, register exact callback URL in Canva, then perform real interactive OAuth testing.

Security notes: client-secret rotation requires Canva re-authorisation; GitHub Actions secrets are NOT implicitly available to a Netlify runtime. This public repository must not contain API secrets, customer data or high-resolution master artwork.

Next: verify tests; deploy isolated Netlify callback; authorise once; then build a single-writer refresh mechanism and audited Canva exporter before listing/fulfilment work.

## Netlify project reserved (2026-10-08)

- Project name: sapiver-poster-gen-auth.
- Netlify project ID: d1753fca-2098-4b96-a684-75921df7c3da.
- Target origin: the value of the Netlify environment variable CANVA_SITE_ORIGIN (not copied into the public repo).
- Required Canva redirect: append /canva/callback to CANVA_SITE_ORIGIN.
- **The project is newly created and NOT deployed or connected to GitHub yet.** The target redirect is NOT live until a successful deploy.
- Tests checked using a local Node 22 copy with Git blob hashes verified against GitHub: all 4 OAuth helper tests passed. Server function passes node --check with matching Git blob hash. **Real Netlify build and Canva OAuth exchange remain untested.**
- Manual steps remaining: Netlify UI link repository and select feature branch; add CANVA_CLIENT_ID, CANVA_CLIENT_SECRET, CANVA_SETUP_PASSWORD (20+ random characters) and CANVA_SITE_ORIGIN in Netlify environment with Functions scope; deploy; add redirect in Canva; authorise once.

## 2026-10-08 — Deploy diagnostic

The first deployment after saving environment variables failed. Investigation identified that CANVA_SITE_ORIGIN was marked as a secret and its exact value had been copied into this public status document. Netlify scans repositories and build output for configured secret values and can fail the deploy on a match. Removed this unnecessary literal while preserving the formula for finding the redirect. Confirm the next deploy logs to verify whether secret scanning was the actual failure mechanism; do not disable scanning or expose credential values.
